SuperValueConverters is a collection of powerful property value converters for Umbraco, eliminating the need for casting and null checks on Umbraco picker values in views or controllers and helping to keep code cleaner.

## Getting started

SuperValueConverters is supported on Umbraco 8.

Once installed you don't need to do anything to activate SuperValueConverters.

### Installation

SuperValueConverters is available from Our Umbraco, NuGet, or as a manual download directly from GitHub.

#### Our Umbraco repository

You can find a downloadable package, along with a discussion forum for this package, on the [Our Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.com/projects/developer-tools/supervalueconverters/) site.

#### NuGet package repository

To [install from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Our.Umbraco.SuperValueConverters/), run the following command in your instance of Visual Studio.

    PM> Install-Package Our.Umbraco.SuperValueConverters

## Usage

Where a picker that returns multiple items _(such as [MNTP](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/Getting-Started/Backoffice/Property-Editors/Built-in-Property-Editors/Multinode-Treepicker2) or [Nested Content](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/Getting-Started/Backoffice/Property-Editors/Built-in-Property-Editors/Nested-Content))_ has been configured to only allow a single item to be selected _(via it's "maxItems" setting)_, the returned value will now be a single `IPublishedContent` rather than `IEnumerable<IPublishedContent>`.

Supported value converters will no longer return `null` if no value has been picked - an empty collection will be returned instead, preventing the need for null checks.

Currently the following datatypes are supported:

* Multi-Node Tree Picker
* Nested Content

### Models Builder

SuperValueConverters works seamlessly with [Models Builder](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/Reference/Templating/Modelsbuilder/) _(if you're using it)_ to return the correct model types from pickers rather than `IPublishedContent`.

Where a picker has been configured to only allow items of a specific doctype, the returned value will be already cast to the relevant Models Builder generated model.

In cases where an allowed doctype uses [compositions](https://our.umbraco.com/Documentation/Reference/Templating/Modelsbuilder/Using-Interfaces) Models Builder will generate an interface for that model. If more than one allowed doctype on a given picker implements the same interface, the returned value will be cast to the shared interface rather than the default `IPublishedContent`.
